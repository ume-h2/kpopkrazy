     <h2> Solo </h2>
    <p> There are many solo artists in the Kpop industry. 
        Many are well known while others are under appreciated. 
        Solo culture is quite different in Koop. 
        Many members of a group would have to go to the military due to civil requirements and
         the remaining members would produce and promote their solo, they would be “going” solo 
         for that time even when being a part of a group. 
        This applies to both male and female. The military requirements apply to only male groups. 
        It applies to every male korean celebrity, whether they are an actor, singer or entertainer.
</p>
    <p> There are many female soloists circulating. 
        Many soloists had originated from leaving their groups or because of the disbandment of their group. 
        One famously known solo artist is TAEYEON. 
        TAEYEON is famously known for being a part of the girl group Girls Generation. 
        Girl’s Generation is also known as SNSD, they have not disbanded but members have left the group.
       Another famous solo artist is Chungha. She had debuted 3 years ago on June 6. 2017 with her solo album
     “Hands on Me'' at the age of 21. 
 
    <p> Solo culture is ultimately male dominated because of the militarial leaves of group members. 
        They are also promoted while their group is not promoting.
        One soloist who was not in a group is Eric Nam, who had recently released his full English album. 
        Another soloist who is promoting while his members are busy and in the military is KAI from EXO. 
        There are members of EXO who had joined military this year and a few are coming back from military in 2021 
 
 
    <p> Lately the soloist I’ve been constantly listening to JAE of Day6, the 5 member band.
         He isn’t a soloist but he produces and promotes his own music time to time
