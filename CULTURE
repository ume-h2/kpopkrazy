    <h2> Merchandise </h2>
    <p>In the culture of Kpop, Artist and Groups would release physical albums along with digital albums. </p>
    
    <p> The albums generally would include 1/2 photocards, a poster, a photobook, a tracklist and a CD.</p>
     <p> Lightsticks are run originally in asian music culture. 
       They are a lightstick that are originally made uniquely for the groups and artists. 
       Lightsticks are used during concerts and award ceremonies to show the 
       representation and support for the group/artist.</p>
       <p> They would also release limited edition merch that fights with their time of comeback.   </p>

  <div class="column middle">
    <h2> Culture </h2>
    <p> Kpop is Korean Pop music that originated from South Korea.
       Kpop is not limited to pop music but the most popular genre is pop so it is referred to Kpop. 
       Korean Names would go by last name to first name. 
       Kpop groups aren't limited to koreans only, 
       many artists from asian countries would fly into korea to train to be an idol.
        Those group members would be known as foreign members since they are from out of the country. 
</p>
    <p> Another cultural thing that runs in kpop is giving your fandom a name.
       Many western Artists would just call them "fans'' but kpop groups and
        artists would give them specific names that would fit their own group name.
         One popular girl group named Twice had named their fandom Once. 
         Many artists would name their fandoms that way. It is quite special.</p> 
         
         
         
         
<p> There are 3 companies that are known as the big three and are the roots of kpop and are a big part of 
  history for korean music. The roots of kpop run quite deep. 
  The three companies are SM, JYP, and YG. SM is run by the CEO and founder of the company Lee Soo Man.
   JYP is founded by Park Jinyoung but is run by JYPE. 
   YG was founded by Yang Hyun-Suk but it is run by Hwan Bo-Kyung.
    YG Entertainment was taken over by Hwan Bo-Kyung during June of 2019 because of the continuous scandals of YG.
     Ever since the election of the new CEO it has started running better than the past years. </p>
