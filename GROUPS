       <h2> Groups </h2>
      <p> Kpop groups are split between boy and girl groups. 
          There are also co-ed groups which would be a small group of two duos of male and female. 
          They would also be female/male trios or duos. Groups consist of many ages and areas.
Joining an idol group is not limited to Koreans only, 
it is open to people from Japan, China, Vietnam, Thailand and many more people of Asian ethnicity. 
They were trying for years under the company, to learn Korean and fit the “standard “. 
Those people would be called “foreign “line as they are from Korea.
 The foreign idols would face a lot of criticism from Kentz (Korean Citizens). </p> 
 <p>
  
  Girl groups with our religion we made up of 5 to 7 members.
  There are girl groups who have more members such as LOONA. 
  LOONA is a girl group which is made up of 12 members.
   Many girl groups are unconfirmed during their training time
    as one famous with “black pink“ was originally planned to be a 
    five member idol group but debuted as a  group of four. 
    Lately the groups that are debuting newly in 2020 are small and competent.
The competition has largely increased as the audience nowadays prefer a smaller group to stan.  </p> 
     
     <p>
  
  Boy groups are not only idol groups but also bands. 
  Idol groups or groups who sing and dance when performing.
   Bands or a group of musicians who would perform using their instruments rather than dancing like the “normal". 
   Most groups are from 4/5+ members. The largest group I know of is NCT.
    NCT is a boy group that is made up of 23 members. 
    The group has more foriegn members than Korean.
     There is a Chinese subunit called “WayV". 
     The rest of the large group is mixed with Japanese, 
     Chinese, one person from Thailand, American, and one person from Canada named Mark. </p>
      <p>
  
  Lately I have been trying to get into the small group named “THE BOYZ“. 
  The BOYZ is an 11 member boy band who debuted in 2017.
